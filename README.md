Unity3DSampleProject
==============

This is a Unity3D project containing a collection of simple scripts in C# and scenes which show them in action.

The following are the names and a brief decription of the scripts:

1) BloodSmear.cs - This creates a blood smear effect on the screen by interpolating the transparency of the texture.
2) BoundingFrame.cs - This script is used to draw a 2D frame around an object using it's bounding box.
3) SineWave.cs - This is script to generate a sine wave motion in x,y plane. (Snake like animation)
